The villagers often spoke of the clock tower with a mix of affection and mild suspicion, for it was said that on certain nights, when the moon hung low and the mist curled like restless spirits along the riverbanks, the hands of the clock would move backward, ever so slightly, as if attempting to undo moments already lived. No one could ever prove it, of course, but tales passed from grandparent to child spoke of odd happenings — a misplaced key appearing in a long-forgotten drawer, an unanswered letter suddenly finding its way to its recipient, or a wilted rose blooming anew on a frosty morning. The villagers went about their lives under the gaze of the clock tower, tending to sheep, harvesting apples, and gathering in the square each Sunday for the market. There, one could find jars of wildflower honey, loaves of bread crusted with seeds, handwoven baskets, and sometimes, a musician strumming a lute or an old storyteller spinning yarns about pirates and forgotten kings. At the heart of this community was Old Elias, the keeper of the clock tower, a man of indeterminate age with silver hair cascading like a waterfall down his back and eyes the color of storm clouds. Elias spoke little, but when he did, his voice carried the weight of decades and secrets best left undisturbed. Many a child, wide-eyed and clinging to a parent’s hand, had asked Elias about the strange stories tied to the clock, but he would only smile, a cryptic curve of his weathered lips, and say, “Time is a curious thing, my dears. It does not always follow the road you think it should.” Rumor held that Elias had once been a great traveler, a man who had sailed upon seas that shimmered like glass and crossed deserts where the sand sang beneath your feet. His cottage, nestled beside the tower, was filled with strange artifacts — masks carved from obsidian, maps drawn in languages no one recognized, and tiny glass bottles holding what appeared to be captured starlight. Few dared to venture inside, though, for the place carried an air of ancient magic and the scent of forgotten places. One autumn evening, when the leaves burned orange and crimson, and a chill began to creep into the air, a stranger arrived in the village. Clad in a long coat of deep indigo and carrying a walking stick topped with a sphere of pale green stone, he spoke with a voice that seemed both young and impossibly old. No one knew his name, but he took up residence in the old inn by the river, and odd things began to happen. The night he arrived, the hands of the clock tower spun in a slow, deliberate circle, and the village’s dogs howled as one. Children’s dreams were filled with images of silver cities beneath the sea, and an eerie melody seemed to drift on the wind, though no instrument could be found. The villagers watched the stranger with a wary curiosity, whispering behind cupped hands and pulling their scarves tighter. Elias, however, greeted the man with a knowing nod, as though recognizing an old companion returned from some distant shore. And though no one could say for certain what passed between them in the hours before dawn, by morning, the clock’s hands were still, the mist had lifted, and the stranger was gone — leaving behind a single note pinned to the tower’s oak door: “Time remembers.”
